            <p>
                ModAhead is for <b>Computer Science students in National University of Singapore (NUS)</b> who want to plan their modules 
                ahead of time and towards graduation. The current workflow require students to use a combination of Excel sheet, NUSMods, 
                What-if Report and the NUS Computer Science course curriculum page. As such, the process of planning towards graduation often
                require students to switch between these tools, making the planning very tedious and error prone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the design of <b>ModAhead</b>, we hope to improve the experience of CS students doing long term planning of their
                modules by integrating the functionalities of the current tools used so that they can be rest assured that they 
                are on track towards graduation.

            <div class="subtitle">User Identification</div>
            <p>
              The targeted user group for this project is chosen to be <b>Computer Science (CS) students from NUS</b>. This group of students 
              are being selected due to the flexibility of scheduling. This flexibility arises from the fact that CS students in NUS can
               choose from a total of 10 focus areas. This wide range of focus area means that there are a lot of ways for a student to plan 
               and schedule their curriculum. Therefore, making it a good precursor towards a more general module planner.
            </p>
            <p>
              By focusing on CS students in NUS, we aim to provide a personalized user experience that is representative of the academic
               planning decisions a CS student would take in their course of study in NUS.
            </p>

            <div class="subtitle">Methodology of Study</div>
            <p>
              In order to gain insights on the different workflows and pain points that the students may have in scheduling, we decided to
              conduct surveys and interviews. The online survey will serve as an efficient method to provide us with as many responses as 
              possible. This is helpful as we need to find out how different students with different focus areas plan their modules and what 
              are the considerations they usually take while doing so. Through the survey, we identified the interesting submissions and conducted 
              online interview on them. The additional use of interviews can help fill the gaps that the questionnaires leave, since it is not
              possible to get deep insight solely using questionnaires.
            </p>
            <p>
              In total, we have collected 20 responses for the online survey. Among the 20 responses, 16 are Year-3 students while 4 are Year-4 students. 
            </p>
            <p>
              For the interviews, there are a total of 5 online interviews conducted. Among the 5 interviewees, 4 are Year-3 students while 1 is Year-4 student.
            </p>

            <div class="subtitle">Insights</div>
            <p>
              Through the survey and interviews, we have come up with an overview of problems and tools that the students would usually use. 
              In addition, we have also gained a better understanding of the planning habits of CS students in NUS.

            <p>
              This persona created base on the surveys and interviews being conducted. It is a generic persona that will be helpful in creating 
              ModAhead as it can help us uncover the common the pain points that CS students faces in NUS while planning for graduation.

            <div class="subtitle">General Workflow</div>
            <p>
              For the identified persona, we came up with a workflow that students would usually take when it comes to module planning towards graduation. 
              This workflow is separated into 3 phases which starts from “Gathering Data”, “Planning” and lastly “Checking and Validating”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general pain points are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>There is no integrated tool for facilitate the 3 phases of the workflow.</li>
              <li>Students constantly needing to switch between different phases and tools.</li>
              <li>In an unfortunate event when the planned schedule is not possible, will be very tedious and frustrating to plan again.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="subtitle">Initial Prototype 1</div>
            <p>
              The idea in which this prototype is built upon is based on allowing students to choose the modules that they want to take and place them on
              the “Module Basket” first before adding them into the schedule. This step by step process will reduce the student’s cognitive load at each
              stage as the student will only need to worry about 1 thing in each process. What the UI aim to achieve is that in the event when the desired 
              module is deemed not fit for the schedulable, it is supposed to facilitate the changing of modules easily. With the above idea in mind, we came
              up with the following prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              By clicking on the “What is left” button, a modal with the remaining module that the student needs to take will appear. The student then chooses
              those modules that he or she is missing. These chosen modules will then be added into the “Module Basket” where the student will then schedule them.

            <p>
                This prototype was based on the idea of allowing students the maximum flexibility in selecting the modules for each semester. Features of this
                prototype include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation Bar on the left side of the page containing: <b>Timetable, Plan and Progress</b></li>
                <li>Auto-Generation of a schedule based on the duration of a course and the track of the student</li>
                <li>Plan for each semester on the left pane</li>
                <li>Search and filtering of modules on the right pane</li>
                <li>Progress overview which includes completion status and CAP</li>
                <li>Progress for each completed semester</li>
                <li>Syncing results with edurec</li>

            <div class="subtitle">Initial Prototype 3</div>
            <p>
                This prototype aims to fufill the user's goals by having 3 main tabs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A Timetable page to allow students to plan for their semester timetable, similiar to NUSMods.</li>
                <li>An Academic Planner page that allows students to freely add any modules to their plan. This page will automatically show the students any missing modules that they have in their plan in order to graduate.</li>
                <li>A Course Settings page that is used for students to set their Focus Area and any exempted modules that they have, which is used by the software when calculating the user's missing modules in their plan.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The idea behind having these pages is to keep the number of interactable tabs to a minimum for simplicity, whilst allowing students to freely plan their modules and alert them when they do not meet the graduation requirements.

            <div class="subtitle">Initial Prototype 4</div>
            <p>
                This prototype was designed to allow student to plan modules for all semesters with error detection to help CS students ensure that they will be able to graduate by their targeted graduation year. This means that the graduation requirements must be readily available and there should be some error checking to ensure that the student is constantly informed about any scheduling issues. Being able to sync with NUS EduRec system will also be a great help as they do not need to manually enter a lot of information, especially for student in later years of candidature. Some of the features of the prototype includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Signing in to EduRec</li>
                <li>Adding Modules by searching and suggestions</li>
                <li>Deleting Modules</li>
                <li>Undoing Deletion</li>
                <li>Reporting of error for both semester and overall plan</li>
                <li>Setting of user personalization information like study track, exemptions, etc.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="title text-primary-light">Expert Review</div>
            <p>
                With the prototypes above, we came up with a plan to have them evaluated by our peers as a form of expert review.
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">Evaluation Plan</div>
            <p>
               Firstly, we decided that we would want each of the peer reviewer review 2 prototype each. We then came up with an order as to how we want our prototypes to be presented to them. We wanted to ensure that each prototype has a chance to come before and after another, and as such, we assign a unique prototype to each of the 4 reviewers to be the first prototype. We did the same for the second prototype with the condition of no reviewer gets a repeat so each prototype gets 2 reviews by 2 different person.
            </p>
            <p>
               Next, We created a document of instructions for the reviewers, as well as the feedback format. For the format of feedback, we use a combination of 2 things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The post-site questionaire from the Usability Test Plan Toolkit.</li>
                <li>A table for general comments for each task in regards to the prototype they are evaluating.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               We wanted to use the post-site questionaire to rate the usability of each prototype. The table of general comments is so we know if there are any problems with the flow of each prototype.
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">Findings</div>
            <p>
               After getting back the reviews from our peers, we compiled the information and achieved the following findings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Prototype 1
                    <ul>
                        <li>The + button in the year box is thought to be for adding modules instead of adding Special Term</li>
                        <li>"Add unselected modules" seems ambiguous as the user does not know what context "unselected" means as there is no elements that seems "selected"</li>
                        <li>Removal seems to be awkward and unintuitive as you need to perform multiple steps</li>
                        <li>No indication of schedule being duplicated successfully</li>
                        <li>Some improvement can be made in regards to resolving prerequisite error as the user has to do extra work to manually move back the module to the module basket</li>
                        <li>Average Usability Score: 52.5</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Prototype 2
                    <ul>
                        <li>The UI is clear and straightforward for adding and removing a module</li>
                        <li>The sign in should use the actual EduRec log in so that the user know that it is safe</li>
                        <li>It was not obvious that the width of the pill is used to indicate the number of MCs for a module</li>
                        <li>For the edit modal in Semester Progress, the module code which is not to be edited is placed in a box that is of the same design as the input box, leading to confusion</li>
                        <li>Average Usability Score: 81.25</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Prototype 3
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finding where to add exempted modules will take a bit of getting used to</li>
                        <li>Add missing module was not easy to do as it was hard to find the Missing Pre-requisites section</li>
                        <li>Timetable feature was intuitive but the user would expect the modules to be added to the timetable already after adding to the planner</li>
                        <li>Deleting of modules is intuitive in general</li>
                        <li>Modals for entering sign up details feels unnecessary</li>
                        <li>The buttons in the sign up screen can confuse the user</li>
                        <li>Average Usability Score: 60</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Prototype 4
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not sure where to place attention, perhaps an indicator of active semester would be helpful</li>
                        <li>Deleting modules and Undoing is intuitive, might want to consider keyboard shortcuts like "Ctrl + Z" and how long the undo message should stay on screen</li>
                        <li>Could use a some form on indicator to allow users to easily find which semester has issues instead of reading the text in the Planning Notice</li>
                        <li>Users should be allowed to sync/login without navigating to another page</li>
                        <li>The sign in should use the actual EduRec log in so that the user know that it is safe</li>
                        <li>Average Usability Score: 80</li>
                    </ul>

            <div class="subtitle">Decision of Hifi Prototype</div>

               Once we have consolidated the findings of each prototype, we decided to combine elements of each prototype to come up with the Hifi Prototype to be used for User Testing.

              Our User Testing involves a total of 5 participants that tested our Hi - Fi prototype individually over an online meeting. <br/>
              The participants were asked to carry out tasks using the prototype that was presented to them. Whilst performing these tasks, they were encouraged to think aloud and voice out any opinions and thoughts that they had. <br/>
              After conducting the user testing, we had the participants answer a few questionaires regarding the prototype, as well as logged any interesting details that we could find while watching the recordings of the user testing.

            <div class="subtitle">Findings</div>
            <p>
              Below is a list of points that our team came up with after discussing the logs and questionaires that we obtained through the user testing:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The "+" icon that was intended for adding special terms in our schedule planner was often mistaken for adding modules to the schedule.</li>
              <li>The search function for finding modules was more often used for adding modules compared to the panel of modules that were presented to the user.</li>
